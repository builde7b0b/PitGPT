# Quick Fix for "src refspec main does not match any" Error

cd /Users/wealthybigbean/PitGPT

# 1. Make sure git is configured
git config user.email "ggives3@gmail.com"
git config user.name "builde7b0b"

# 2. Initialize if needed
git init

# 3. Add all files
git add -A

# 4. Create initial commit (THIS IS THE KEY - need at least one commit)
git commit -m "Initial commit: PitGPT - Real-Time Race Strategy"

# 5. Set branch to main (can only do this after a commit exists)
git branch -M main

# 6. Set remote
git remote remove origin 2>/dev/null
git remote add origin git@github.com:builde7b0b/PitGPT.git

# 7. Now push (should work now that branch exists)
git push -u origin main

# If SSH doesn't work, try HTTPS:
# git remote set-url origin https://github.com/builde7b0b/PitGPT.git
# git push -u origin main
